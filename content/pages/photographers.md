This is a small collection of people whose work I like, admire or find interesting or inspiring in some way.

**LARRY SULTAN**  
Personal documentary work, with beautiful colors and strong emotions in calm compositions.  
His "Pictures from Home" is perhaps the best example.

**JOEL STERNFELD**  
Master of context and environment. I like his pair of "Campagna Romana" and "Rome after Rome", also made "Walking the High Line". Best known probably for "American Prospects".

**MIKE BRODIE** (Polaroid Kid)  
Current vagabond cool kid, going along with the drifters, rodatrippers he shoots. 70s youth counterculture in the 2020s. His style is harsh, rough, naive.

**CHARALAMPOS KYDONAKIS** (dirtyharrry)  
Subjective documentarian (not sure if he would label himself as such). Grungy, technically imperfect style that he seeks out with purposely crappy lenses. Always fun, surprising, a bit in-your-face but not unpleasantly so (like eg. Gilden or his younger imitators).

**ROBBIE LAWRENCE**  
Tight, personal, very painterly, people-focused work. If it's a portrait, dark red and has a very simple, very strong composition, it's probably him. Found him through his coverage of the 2024 Olympics.

**ANTHONY SUAU**  
His "Beyond the Fall" is perhaps the best project on the transformation of Eastern Europe as the Soviet block fell.

**TRENT PARKE**  
Primarily known for strong, surreal black-and-white work. Beyond his visual style lie very philosophical, contemplative projects about humanity. Found his latest, "Monument" first.
