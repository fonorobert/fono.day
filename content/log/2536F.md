It has been a while again. I have been through a few deep rabbit holes in the past few weeks. My job fell apart, then reintegrated, then I got offered another job. All of it exhausting, none of it very interesting.

With the new job I expect to move into soon, I am switching back to a thinking-and-connecting role. I'll need to conduct more meetings, take more notes, produce more documents, think more about systems and projects. This switch plus the (hopefully) accompanying relative financial stability means I'm thinking about switching up my tools again.

The move to an IT/infrastructure role pushed me towards text based, terminal based, hacker-ish tooling. This coincided with my last iPad breaking and not having the means to replace it. So no "casual thinking" device, only laptops. With the current move, it'd make sense to go back to the more visual, more intuitive, less code and more thought based workflow I used to work with.

It's very late and I'm not thinking clearly anymore, but I do think the series of rabbitholes and the accompanying wired-anxious mood I've been in comes partly from the tools I use and the way they frame my thinking.

So, back to visual, back to casual, lightweight, back to the iPad, maybe.

Well, anyways.
