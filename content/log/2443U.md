Read a Facebook comment today, under a post showcasing some basic background swapping on a portrait with some AI tool. The comment was something to the effect of: "It's all good as long as the average person doesn't learn to use this. But once every other Joe and his 2 year old with a 'touch phone' can do background swapping, face tuning, body editing, etc. on images, that's when photographers will be in trouble. At that point, we'll be out of business and photography as a profession will be dead."

I am of course aware that in applied work, in fashion and other commercial genres extensive editing has been the norm forever. But to equate this with "photography as a profession"? It's like saying that digital photography killed the profession because a professional photographer is someone who can expose and develop slide film correctly. Yes, digital changed the industry and some people, the people whose only qualification was "can operate a stills camera", were pushed out. Individually, it sucks when a person loses their job, even more so, when they lose their profession. But as a discipline, as a field? I think photography is better off.

I don't like generative AI too much and find the truth-bending potential of image and video generators to be dangerous. But it's a danger like the wolves migrating to your forest. It changes things, you'll have to adapt and they might eat you. They will most definitely eat your sheep. You can lament the loss of the good old wolfless days, but the wolves are here now and you can't wish them away.

Politically, ideologically I'd love to live in a society that considers people's interests before some VS funded AI snakeoil company. That would be a better, more just place to live. Practically, however all I can see is small scale wins for the people and large scale wins-by-default for the corporations. If we all somehow banded together, we *might* be able to push the wolves back a bit. But I don't think we can bet our lives only on that happening. So organize and try to push back on the wolves, but also, be prepared for what you will do once all your sheep are eaten.

In photography, as in elsewhere in the arts, there has always been applied work. But the heart of photography is no one specific genre or business model. The heart of photography is that it captures light and time. Whatever genre you work in, be it nature, documentary, fashion, weddings, whatever, capturing light and time is what you do. As a field I don't think we lose too much with some schmock not being able to make a living on photoshopping women thinner. The industry will change, it might shrink a lot, but the heart, that we won't lose because software can't capture, it can only simulate. Will anybody pay us to photograph? I don't know. But if what photography means to you is really the business of photography, then I don't think we have much in common besides owning a camera.
