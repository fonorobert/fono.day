I can't think clearly when there is a footbal game going in the background in Hungarian. I'm at work again, another evening spent in a small broadcast technician's booth.  
I had many things on my mind today, but the most important was the following realization:

My mind needs a job where someone hands me clearly defined tasks that I am competent in executing. On the other hand my ego still clings to some ambition for doing something that matters, something to leave a mark, something that's creative and important. I still cling to the idea that having a regular job is just a temporary way to make money and bide my time while I work on building myself up as a Great Photographer. I feel like I am supposed to be working on projects and publicity and building up my potential to rely on my art somewhere down the line. This makes it impossible to relax, to feel contented. I get after a full day at my job and an evening shift at my second job and I don't feel like I've done enough. Any day I don't spend working on my photography or at least worrying about it feels wasted.

In reality I bet if I could accept that having a stable job and making money is enough, and that art should be for having fun and recharging, I would be happier. I would feel better about myself if I could get rid of the irrational feeling that I'm always supposed to be doing more, striving for greatness. So many people are able to do this, to have a job that pays the bills and be happy with that and have calm, free mind space for making art when they have the time and feel like it. I wish I was one of those people.

Well, anyways.
