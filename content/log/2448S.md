I've gone down a hyperfocus hole these past two days about finding a 
cheap, handheld Linux terminal device. I was dreaming about setting up 
a terminal-only environment on it, with things like a Beeper client, a 
git repo for text notes, little python scripts, drafting logs here and 
posts for my website.

I think what draws me to this idea is a feeling that the little apps 
and utilities in a Unix system are like little creatures, with 
personalities and quirks and behaviors that I can interact with. These 
software-creatures are easier, because while they have personalities 
to make them interesting and they "talk back" to me, they are clearly 
defined, knowable. I can get to know them and be confident that I know 
what buttons to push to get what results.

In real life it's not so easy. Real humans are not so thoroughly
knowable, they are squishy and large and complex inside, real people
are infinite. That's scary, so I try to retreat to my safe little
digital creatures. I look for this in places like 
[tilde.town](https://tilde.town), as well as in regular smartphone apps
and little obsessions like the current one. I want my safe, finite,
controllable digital creatures, that I can puzzle out and then once I
did, I can know them forever.
