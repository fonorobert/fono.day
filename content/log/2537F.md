There is a certain feeling that I tend to like in pictures, mine and of others. I couldn't really pin it to a single emotion, althought it is certainly about emotion. There is an element of dissonance, of awkwardness to it. I like pictures that look like I just walked in on someone doing something not meant for me to see. It doesn't have to be embarassing, often it's tender, honest in that soft, simple, bumbling human kind of way. Drama, strength, beauty, character are never as interesting as those private moments of people being people, not playing any kind of role. 

It's an awkward position to be in, liking this type of intimacy in photography. There is no clear way to create the situation to photograph someone as they're being themselves. It's not something you can orchestrate too easily. What you can do is being bold, being almost shameless in raising the camera just as someone locks eyes with you, only just realising they are not alone, they are being seen.

Well, anyways.
