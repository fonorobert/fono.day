I kept thinking after [yesterday](/log/2551F), and I think what I'm looking for is something like a "mission log" tool, a bit like how Mark Watney would periodically sit down to lay out what he's been doing in The Martian. It's part official record, part thinking out loud (or in text in this case) and part pseudo-public memoir, like a blog with a potential audience, but probably not a real one. Mark's log is written initially to the people who he assumes will discover his base after he's dead, so he writes it like someone will read it but like nobody is currently reading it.

- feels pseudo-public
- supports the daily log format (one or more entries/day, append only, maybe merge the day's entries)
- markdown-based

I have a few candidates in mind, like Bear, Agenda, or a
