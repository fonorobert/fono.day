I kept thinking after [yesterday](/log/2551F), and I think what I'm looking for is something like a "mission log" tool, a bit like how Mark Watney would periodically sit down to lay out what he's been doing in The Martian. It's part official record, part thinking out loud (or in text in this case) and part pseudo-public memoir, like a blog with a potential audience, but probably not a real one. Mark's log is written initially to the people who he assumes will discover his base after he's dead, so he writes it like someone will read it but like nobody is currently reading it.

This log is a good way to do this, but there are some personal details I'd rather not put out publicly, but that could benefit from a thinking-through in writing like this. So maybe I am looking for a solution that's:
- private
- feels pseudo-public
- supports the daily log format (one or more entries/day, append only, maybe merge the day's entries)
- markdown-based

I have a few candidates in mind, like Bear, Agenda, or even a second git repo.

What really matters is the feeling of a closed loop, the feeling of hitting "publish". So a private git repo is better than a note taking or writing app. But a private blog would be even better! Something password protected, but it still feels like I might be able to make it public at some point, and until then it still feels like I publish, so there is a natural state of "finishedness" to each day's log.

A good way to do this would be to have a writing app that has a publishing action to the private blog, so during the day it syncs through cloud, not manual git pushing and pulling whenever I switch devices, and at the end of the day I still hit publish.
