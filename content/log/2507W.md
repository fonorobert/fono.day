I'm not motivated to make things because i don't think anybody would care, and what's the point of making stuff for the drawer. Art is meant to be seen.

The [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info) has procedurally generated 410 page books in shelves of 32 volumes, walls of 5 shelves in hexagons (blocks/rooms) of 4 walls. So 640 books/hexagon, 262 400 pages/hexagon.  
It's all possible 410 page books.

What project could i make with this? Print out a book with a specific reference? Print out some pages and do something with them? Use the text as a basis for something? Find english words (library has a tool built in), then use that pattern as a basis for photo composition? The possibilities are endless and I'm not sure I like any of them.

I'm going through sorting/archiving my notes app once again. But I keep coming back to the thought that instead of notes searchable, tagged, categorized by topic, it feels better to use this place as a sort of notes/journal spot. It's more sequential, not structured at all, but works like my brain works: it is organized by which day I was thinking about a certain thing.
