Started a [list of photographers](/photographers) I like or admire currently. I think this is a better way of keeping track of them, than having lists in notebooks or links in txt files all over. Just publish the current list, simple, always know where to find it.  
This leads me to think about this site as a personal notebook as well. Somehow works better than a fully private journal.
