Yakshaving is a perfect term. Yakshaving is what I've been doing for days now, maybe a couple of weeks. I know I'm yakshaving when I suddenly find myself very annoyed that I didn't get to finish a particularly meaningless thing that I can't even remember why I MUST finish, and I realize I've been in this mode for a while, not thinking about anything else. Talking to people is a chore, I have to force myself to understand and think through other things. It's not a good feeling. It feels obsessive, it feels like something other than me is in control and it gets angry when it doesn't get its way temporarily.

This is how it happens: I might have an afternoon off, or a slow day at work, some form of unexpected free time. My brain goes "ooo, free time, we should do something, nothing's occupying our focus right now!" and it goes into overdrive to find a thing to do. At this point anything that floats into my field of vision can become the subject of my next hyperfocus. This current time started when I read a bit of news about Microsoft bringing GitHub closer into the organization. I was in a bad mood (because my job feels insecure, but that's another story), so when I read this, and thought about how GitHub might eventually go away like many other things the big four have acquired, my brain latched on with glee. Perfect, something nebulous to be afraid of but have no influence over, but with a specific, practical side!

The first phase was about setting up my own git hosting. It is perfectly logical: I like independent, open-source stuff, I think, philosophically, that the utopia of tech is an open-source world where everybody has their own little website and all our software tools are controlled by us, running smoothly on the family server sitting in everybody's basement. So, let's set up a git server and move all my dead projects and 2 living repos over there from GitHub. But wait, where will I run this server? It can't be on a VPS, cause that means maintenance costs and that's not something I want to start spending $10 each month on. "Luckily" I have a media server running in my mom's house that runs a few VMs for backup and stuff.

Second phase: server setup. How much memory can I allocate, is my hypervisor overprovisioned, jeez these VMs don't have regular backups of the system image, let's add a disk so the new VM has storage, on and on and on. After a few days of this: burnout. I am knee deep in learning Ansible (a tool designed to automate server deployment and management) because I found a project that uses it to set up a few self hosted things, including Gitea, a git server, and frankly, I just can't remember the original goal anymore.

Third phase: restart, build an app, for some reason. I need to stop this madness. I like technology because it can be fun and cute. I like cute little servers that I can play around with. I delete the VM I spent a week setting up, out of frustration, probably. Take a deep breath, find a better, more fun, healthy way to play around with a VM. (Do I remember when this has become about having a VM and looking for something to do with it? No, I don't.) Oh look, a project called "Smallweb" that's a standalone little webserver, serving folders on subdomains, with a cute design and emoji on the docs page. It says it's designed for fun and tinkering! Well, it's JavaScript based, but I know a bit of JavaScript. Fast forward three days: I'm learning server side JS, in an obscure web framework called Hono, I'm banging my head against JSX (templating, don't ask), I'm writing notes, I'm furiously trying to get ChatGPT to ingest the docs to all these tools even its massive training data hasn't heard of, and I'm feeling angry, frustrated and short tempered again.

Meanwhile I started on new ADHD meds (just made my hyperfocus impervious to distractions), set up rules and rituals to finish the day (I ignore them and stay up until 2am doing something I don't remember why I started), my girlfriend's getting more and more worried, I'm constantly slightly dizzy from looking at screens for 18 hours each day and I swear even the dog seems surprised when I fully pay attention to him.

Yakshaving is best described by Seth Godin's [blog post](https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/) on the term. I remember hearing this first with trying to change a lightbulb, but his version works too. Basically, I start with wanting to wash the car. But the garden hose is broken, so I need to buy a new one. But the store parking is paid, so I should borrow my neighbors monthly pass. But I can't until I return the pillow I borrowed from him last month. But I can't, cause the stuffing fell out and it's a yakfur pillow. And before I know it, I'm at the zoo, shaving a yak, just so I can wash the car.

You start with something small and eminently sensible, but that leads to a cascading series of problems and steps and requirements and in the end the whole thing comes crashing down when you're seventeen steps removed from your original goal, in the zoo, shaving a yak. You can't really see the way back from here to the thing that really mattered that led to this, but simultaneously you're completely convinced that this is crucial and the whole project is at risk unless you shave this yak.

I hate this yak. This yak is the only thing in my life that matters. Fuck this yak.

Well, anyways.
