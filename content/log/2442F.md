Yesterday was a messy day. It started out great but devolved into ADHD fuelled chaos and unintended mobile gaming as the day progressed.
It's hard not hating yourself when you feel like you messed things up for your self. But today is a new day.

Working through the Svelte tutorial, so I'll make some notes on new JS concepcts I'm learning.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

ARROW FUNCTIONS - *Intended as a simpler/shorter way to declare small functions.*

Syntax:

```JavaScript
const varname = () => statement;
//vs
const varname = function() { statement };

const varname = (a, b) => a + b;
//vs
const varname = function(a, b) { return a + b };
```

Features:
- implicit return - if only a single statement, it automatically returns it's result
- no `this`

In Svelte it's customary to use these, so better get used to it.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

REACTIVITY ON ASSIGNMENT - *Reactive DOM changes are triggered on value assignment.*

Using JS methods like `.push` doesn't trigger it, so needs sg like a self assignment after.

```JavaScript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); //this didn't trigger reactive DOM update!
numbers = numbers; //thid did
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

KEYED EACH - *use a unique id for each object in an array of object, use that in each block ALWAYS*

Not super clear on underlying issue, something about the underlying `Map` Svelte manipulates for the `each` block. 
Either way, the safe way to do an `each` is:)

```JavaScript
let things = [
	{id: 1, name: "apple"}
];

//then in DOM rendering:
{#each things as thing (thing.id)}
```
(The things objects need to each have a unique id)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

TWO-WAY BINDING - *let changes in value from child element/component update value in parent*

Normally `<input value={name} />` means editing the input's value doesn't update `name`. However `<input bind:value={name} />` makes it two-way, so editing `value` in the input changes `name`.

This should work for components, too, so I can share a value between the parent and child and both can modify it.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

CONDITIONAL OPERATOR - *a `?` to act as a shortened `if` for assignments*

for simple `if` statemens:

```JavaScript
let result = condition ? valueIfTruthy : valueIfNotTruthy;
```
