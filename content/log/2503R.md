I don't know why I keep updating this log, but this feels like the most personal, most authentic, most real thing I currently do online. 
Compared to regular social media (mainly instagram, but also facebook), this doesn't feel like a performance, maybe partly because none of my friends even know about this website.
Compared to my main website, this doesn't feel like a portfolio I should curate for the benefit of potential employers.
I'm not sure what this is for me, this weird braindump-blog, but it's what I want my online presence to be like for sure.  
The question is, how?

I have a few problems. First, what would happen, if people would know about this site? Would the feeling change? 
Second, this type of logging/free writing/stream of consciousness writing works with text and with random thoughts, but what about photography? 
I'm not sure how that would work, what would be the photography analog to this type of journaling.

The key benefit for me here is that I don't really think about what I will put here and I don't edit this at all. 
That's the magic of this space: I can sit down and start typing, usually as a way to think something through, to verbalize my feelings on something that I'm contemplating or fixated on in a given day.  
But with photography I'm not sure how I can NOT edit, it kinda doesn't work that way. 
Even if I manage to photograph completely intuitively (another challenge I'll discuss later on), I'll still end up with a lot more pictures than I want to post, anywhere. 
That means I'll need to look through them and pick the ones I want to put up, and hey, that's editing! That's more time contemplating, judging, selecting and this is exactly what I want to avoid. 
Avoiding this is mental judging and weighing and editing is what makes this log fun and freeing for me.
