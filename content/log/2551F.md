What happened to the "computer desk"? I don't mean the type of furniture, of course that's around in its newest cyborg iteration, whirring itself higher and lower as if you were ever going to use it as a standing desk. I mean the small desk tucked away in a corner or maybe even a separate room of your house that the computer lived on. It was tiny, just big enough to hold a CRT screen and some post-it notes, and it had a slideout keyboard drawer for hiding even your peripherals when you weren't actively using them.

When computers lived in specific physical locations, the internet did, too. We used to have to specifically choose to go to the computer and switch it on to do computer stuff and internet stuff. Of course we still have desktops and even my laptop is mostly sitting tethered to a large screen and external drives on my desk. But that's just one specific computer. "Computer" and "internet" are always with us now. I don't think that's something I can (or want to) fight necessarily, but I don't like how I default to staring at one of many differently sized computer screens whenever I'm not actively engaged in a task for a couple seconds.

What I mean by "defaulting" is that whenever I would normally need to think a moment about what to do next or when sitting with no stimuli for a few seconds would get my brain going, I instinctively reach for my phone or unlock my laptop. Since I haven't yet decided what's next to do, I open email, Instagram, Facebook, the two news sites I read, Instagram again, Facebook again, YouTube and finally land on scrolling through short videos on one of these platforms. This is where my sense of focus, time and purpose usually switch off completely. How long I spend scrolling like this depends on how intense the growing panic in my chest gets. Because I know I shouldn't be doing this, I don't want to do this and I'm still aware of the mountain of other things I wanted to do before I got sucked in, a deep anxious feeling starts building, a mix of self hatred, a sense of doom and increasing fear and overwhelm. Eventually this blossoms into full-fledged panic, which, when it gets intense enough, will finally kick me out of the scrolling daze I got sucked into. It's like a gravity well that these devices and these situations have. I get too close, and I get pulled in, and I need a lot of external energy to get up to escape velocity and be able to break orbit.

SOLUTION I WANT: analog tools, notebook, analog-only desk + some setup that mimicks the old "computer desk", makes it a deliberate choice to now go use the computer for something.

also a good device for this? or just change my setup? i can't really go all linux or all old-macbook-air, since a lot of what i use the computer for needs stuff like lightroom and muse, stuff that won't run on these. mac, probably, maybe keep the current setup, just change the default somehow so it's not sucking me in the moment I sit down at the desk.

plus use the air for a calmer writing devices. this works great for that, feels much better!
