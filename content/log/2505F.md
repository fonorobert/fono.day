Quick note today on thoughts around feeling blocked with photography. 

Got into mode of only big, only project, only what matters. No play, no fun, no practice and crucially no building step by step. I want to make a zine, a book, a complete project. Then I feel lost and confused when editing/sequencing. That's cause I never built up to doing a 10-20 image sequence. I jumped straight there.

Next thought:  
Remember Dan Milnor's [picture package videos](https://shifter.media/creative-the-picture-package-01/). Idea is to build a 3-5 image sequence, more conscise, with this few pics it can be more focused, concentrate on a specific event/moment/idea/place. With a 10+ picture set/essay you need more chapters, you need progression. 10 pics about the same thing are boring, 3 are thorough. 1 for context, 1 for the core, 1 for additional detail. Dan's examples are great, too. Build visually, build content wise, but 3-5 pics don't need to be a whole story. Or at least not a detailed one. 3 pics can be a glimpse, an impression. 10 pics need to have a developed narrative.

A picpack doesn't need to be all event, all action. Do detail, do characteristic sections of a bigger thing. Can't show it all, but show the core and hint at it all. Atmosphere, not documentation.

So I'll do picture packages from now on. Shoot for them, and only work in packages. Practice, practice, practice. No big finished story, just 3-5 pic packages.

Need to put the picpacks somewhere. [fono.day/pics](/pics) is good for this. Also want to do tangible stuff. Idea: [6-fold zines](https://colabstudio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/zine-6page.pdf). Easy to make. Has 4 internal pages -> 4 pictures. Front dated + little text if needed, title or sg. Back can have another couple sentences. Pictures inside. Perfect! Shoot and edit picpacks, focus on what's at hand, mini stories from my day. (Story, not plot! Not all action.) Make 6-fold of it right away, print 1 copy, fold, rejoice, put in a box. Do this again and again and again. Not much more effort than putting pics up here.

Next thought:  
Need a frictionless workflow. Workflow here is great cause I don't need to faff with anything. Convert to JPEG in camera, transfer to iPhone, select, send to laptop, put in md file, git commit, push. Very easy, focus on selecting and sequencing, don't need to do anything "around" it. I want a similar workflow for 6 fold zines.  
Idea: pandoc to generate PDF from md. Make it similar to this site: I just make md files, link the pics in them, run a command, bammm! it's built.  
[Found a guide](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) that could be a starting point. Just need to make a good template to rotate and place the pages, after that I have a script I can run that generates a print-ready PDF for a 6fold from a md. Big success!

Next thought:  
Cross process effect on Ricoh GR. And the high-contrast BW effect. Play. Don't make clean stuff always, not everything is *serious business*. Not everything is cool, objective documentary work. Look at [dirtyharrry](https://www.dirtyharrry.com). Fenomenal stuff. Playful, but still valid. Why do I feel that anything that has effects or a playful look isn't valid? Just need to make good photographs either way, filter won't save a bad one.

Well, anyways.
