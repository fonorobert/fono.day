Few points from the last couple days:

- Started thinkingn about what photo projects/shots to esit, sequence for Hungary's press photo awards for 2024
- Got Ricoh GR, feels good, intend to shoot more casual street and daily life stuff, also play with direct flash aesthetic. Pics look great with slightly blue WB on it
- Set up a new homepage here and a section for a photo log: [fono.day/pics](/pics)
- Thinkinh about setting up a long term wardrobe, intentionally selected, classic styled, long lasting sturdy pieces. Whenever something fails, replace it with a lomg term replacement

Well, anyways.
