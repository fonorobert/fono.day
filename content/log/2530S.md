I might need to learn or get better at some things. That's true in general always, of course, but I am it that late nigth modd once again where I think about going indie, or starting a business. And if I want to eventually start a business, I need to both focus on my existing strengths and build up some new skills to complement them.  
My job that I just started in recently seems to be collapsing soon, so I'm thinking about what business to start and how, as I usually do in turbulent times.

The question is what to focus on that gives me the most valuable skills when it comes to starting something new and hopefully profitable. I read through the website of [37signals](https://37signals.com), the makers of, among other things, Basecamp again. I've known about them for a long time, and have often found inspiration in their designs and products. Reading their website and ethos now makes me want to get back into the software/SaaS world. I am nostalgic for the time in the mid 2010s that I worked at an SaaS company and used to feel like this type of business was the futre. Those were the times of Nomadlist, Basecamp, Slack and the like. Software was eating the business world, the big players restricted themselves to building OSs and office suites, the field was open and VC money was everywhere. In those days I dreamt about starting a software business, an indie studio or something similar, building a niche, well designed product and building a digital nomad life funded by it.  
On nights like tonight I feel that old hopefulness that anything is possible and well designed, well built, simple apps hold the key to the future, or at least my future.

My thinking has changed since then of course, as has the industry. Web apps are nothing new, we've learned that not everyone always has a fast, stable internet connection and the internet is about advertising and endless feeds now. A good idea is nothing without good, stable, long lasting implementation. Data is fragile, the field is pretty saturated and there is much less money to be had for free after the post-Covid correction of the software development industry.

There are still people thinking like we used to though. I just recently heard about a friend of a friend in Hungary that is building an AI-driven app for municipal governments to analyze and synchronize local statutes. When I heard about that, I felt that old excitement of a good idea and a solo developer building it from his bedroom.  
I have learned about the importance of not just building, but also selling stuff since then.

All this is to say that I'm sitting here, late at night, and I'm thinking about starting a Ruby on Rails course again. From my past research it seems like the best option for an indie developer for building web app based businesses, an all-in-one tool to cover every need, with good performance, a solid, stable dev environment. Plus 37signals not only uses it but created it, so it feeds my daydreams of building something like they did, on a smaller scale.

Well, anyways.
