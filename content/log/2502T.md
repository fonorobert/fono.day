Big TIL for me: in Markdown you can end a line with two or more trailing spaces and hit new line/enter
to produce a line break!!

My main thing today:   
Not much time to explain stuff, but I have two photobook reviews here that left a big impression
on me today. Both by JÃ¶rg Colberg, both about (beyond the photobook they are critiquing)
the obsession of most of photo-world, most mid-level photographers like myself anyway, with
the fact that cameras can record a very short moment. Like just because the camera is good at
that, that's all photography should be focused on. Street and documentary work especially,
my own work even more so.

Many thoughts, not much time, here are the articles:

[Ambience Decay](https://cphmag.com/ambience-decay/)  
[Splinter](https://cphmag.com/splinter/)

Go read them.

Well, anyways.
